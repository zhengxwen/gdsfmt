Description:	This package provides a high-level R interface to CoreArray
	Genomic Data Structure (GDS) data files, which are portable across
	platforms and include hierarchical structure to store multiple scalable
	array-oriented data sets with metadata information. It is suited for
	large-scale datasets, especially for data which are much larger than the
	available random-access memory. The gdsfmt package offers the efficient
	operations specifically designed for integers with less than 8 bits, since
	a single genetic/genomic variant, such like single-nucleotide polymorphism,
	usually occupies fewer bits than a byte. Data compression and decompression
	are also supported. It is allowed to read a GDS file in parallel with
	multiple R processes supported by the parallel package.
