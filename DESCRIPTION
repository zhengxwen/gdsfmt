Description: This package provides a high-level R interface to
        CoreArray Genomic Data Structure (GDS) data files, which are
        portable across platforms with hierarchical structure to
        store multiple scalable array-oriented data sets with metadata
        information. It is suited for large-scale datasets, especially
        for data which are much larger than the available random-access
        memory. The gdsfmt package offers the efficient operations
        specifically designed for integers of less than 8 bits, since
        a single genetic/genomic variant, like single-nucleotide
        polymorphism (SNP), usually occupies fewer bits than a byte.
        Data compression and decompression are also supported with
        relatively efficient random access. It is allowed to read a GDS
        file in parallel with multiple R processes supported by the
        package parallel.
